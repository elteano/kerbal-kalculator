# Kerbal Kalculator

A helper on your spacefaring adventures, the Kerbal Kalculator will do the math
that you can't be bothered to learn.

Current features are:

-   Orbital Calculator
-   Delta V Calculator

## Orbital Calculator

This handy feature will take the apses for two orbits, and calculate the most
efficient means to get from one orbit to the other. It will also tell you the
velocities of the object at each of the apses.

## Delta V Calculator

This will tell you the Delta V possessed by a vessel based on its Isp, Wet mass
(full fuel), and Dry mass (empty tanks). You may find this useful when
attempting to fuel a vessel using only monopropellant and RCS thrusters.

## Dependencies

This is built using the D language and the GTK3+ library. Ensure that you have
gtk3 installed on your machine before attempting to run. [More information.](https://github.com/gtkd-developers/GtkD/wiki)
